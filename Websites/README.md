# Biscup Game

- This website was part of game on christian event Biscup 2024
- We've had about 300 contestants
- Contestants would scan the QR code and then do the cipher - after that they would receive a code that they would input into mobile app
- This was one of the ways how contestants could earn points for their team
- Problem of this web is that it was made with javascript, that run locally on contestant devices, so if they had some CS knowledge, then they could possible get all these codes
