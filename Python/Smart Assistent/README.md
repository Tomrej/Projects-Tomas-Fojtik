Smart Assistent Brain

This project was made when I was 14 and it was my first GUI project.

Needs:

You need to install Asistent.py and pip libraries: pyttsx3, pywhatkit, datetime, wikipedia, pyjokes, PyQt5, SpeechRecognition, or you can dowload .exe file (I'll add later). You need python 3.9.2 too (https://www.python.org/). That is all for now ðŸ˜€.
