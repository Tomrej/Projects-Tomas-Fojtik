# Binary king autoplay

- This is project that auto plays "Binary king game"
- I've made this code as part of challenge by our teacher
- For this to work I've used openCV and number detection from images
- This code was made in really short amount of time, so it has some known bugs and currently it only works properly on my Linux machine
